## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system
    * A Cloudflare account with Worker functionality enabled
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/askushw07/medium-backend.git](https://github.com/askushw07/medium-backend.git)

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
  cd medium-backend
  npm install

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add required environment variables, such as:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url

add these line in wrangler.toml file
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_prisma accelerate url
jwt_secerete


you can use above secrete in c.process.secreteName

Replace your_postgres_database_url with your actual PostgreSQL connection string.
Replace your_secret_key_for_cookies with a strong secret key for secure cookie signing.

5. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:**
Follow Cloudflare's documentation on deploying Workers applications (https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/api/).
Ensure your Worker script points to the entry point (e.g., index.ts).
